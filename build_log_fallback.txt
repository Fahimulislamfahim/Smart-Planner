[   +2 ms] Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.
[        ] Potential fix: Your project's KGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (D:\projects\Smart Planner\android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of org.jetbrains.kotlin.android.
